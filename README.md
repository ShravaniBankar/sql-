# SQL Injection Vulnerability - Git Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a proof of concept (PoC) for an SQL injection vulnerability. SQL injection is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities, and it occurs when an attacker can manipulate an application's SQL query by injecting arbitrary SQL code. This repository demonstrates how SQL injection can be exploited and the importance of securing web applications against this kind of attack.

**Warning:** This repository is intended for educational purposes only. It should never be used to exploit real-world applications or systems without permission. Always get explicit authorization before testing any system.

## Prerequisites

Before running or testing this vulnerability, ensure you have the following:

- A web application with an injectable SQL query (or a test environment set up).
- A tool like **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP**, or **SQLMap** to help in the detection and exploitation of SQL injections.
- Basic knowledge of SQL queries and web application security.

## Setting Up

To replicate the environment and exploit the SQL injection vulnerability:

### 1. Clone the Repository


2. Set Up the Vulnerable Application
This PoC is designed for a web application running on a local development environment. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or Docker to set up a PHP/Apache/MySQL stack.

Ensure MySQL is running and set up a database called vulnerable_app with the table users.

Import the provided setup.sql file to create the necessary database structure and seed data.

3. Configure the Application
Make sure the application is configured to connect to the database correctly. Update any necessary configuration files (like config.php) to point to your local database server.

4. Start the Application
Ensure the web server (e.g., Apache) is running and navigate to http://localhost to interact with the vulnerable application.

Exploiting the SQL Injection
This repository contains various examples of SQL injection vulnerabilities, including:

Basic SQL Injection

Description: A typical SQL injection in a login form.

Example Payload: username' OR '1'='1 or admin' --

Effect: Allows an attacker to bypass authentication by manipulating the SQL query.

Blind SQL Injection

Description: A form of SQL injection where the attacker does not see the output of their query.

Example Payload: username=admin' AND 1=1--

Effect: Allows attackers to gather information based on the application's response behavior.

Union-Based SQL Injection

Description: An attacker can use the UNION SQL operator to retrieve data from other tables in the database.

Example Payload: username' UNION SELECT null, null, username, password FROM users--

Effect: Retrieves user data from the users table.

Time-Based Blind SQL Injection

Description: Attacker manipulates SQL queries to introduce delays, enabling them to infer true/false conditions.

Example Payload: username' AND SLEEP(5)--

Effect: Confirms if the query returns a true/false condition based on the time delay.

Mitigation
To protect against SQL injection attacks, consider the following best practices:

Use Prepared Statements: Ensure that SQL queries are executed using prepared statements with parameterized queries, which separates the SQL code from the data.

Input Validation: Always validate user inputs for type, length, and format.

Least Privilege: Restrict database user privileges. Ensure that web applications use accounts with the minimum necessary privileges.

Escaping User Input: If prepared statements cannot be used, escape all user input to ensure that it is treated as data, not code.

Error Handling: Avoid displaying detailed error messages to end users. This prevents attackers from gathering information about the underlying database structure.

Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Use a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attacks.
